# Ambition project

(11/2)

The main PHP folder is now deleted and we are switching to NPM and NodeJS.

(14/2)

The project has been migrated to NPM with session and passport auth.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm] (<https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>) to install project dependancies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get "connection rejected" in your browser try to change the port number.
If you still get it try:

```bash
npm run start
npm run devStart
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Native Js

### Backend
